# Container Queries

A collection of demos showing how to use container queries now, while still supporting older browsers.

## Running the Site Locally

```sh
# Clone the git repository and cd into the cloned directory.
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/container-queries.git
cd container-queries

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Build and serve the site at http://localhost:8080/
npm start
```

This starts up a local server on port 8080. To view the site in your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

In addition to building the site and serving it locally, this will also listen for any changes and rebuild the site as needed. This allows you to play around with the code and see your changes locally in the browser.
