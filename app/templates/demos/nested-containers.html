  <h3>The code</h3>

  <p>This demo shows the <a href="#card">Card</a> component nested inside the <a href="#gallery">Gallery</a> component, where each of the Gallery component items serve as the container element for each Card component. As the gallery's matching breakpoint changes, its layout will update and in turn cause a change in size to the card's container element.</p>
